>Kemal is a Fast, Simple, Effective web framework written in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/).

Hello everyone,

Kemal 0.21.0 is here :tada: This release brings long wanted features with more performance :rocket:

## WebSocket Context :cookie: 

A long wanted feature, allows one to use `HTTP::Server::Context` in `ws` declarations :heart_eyes: This would allow accessing named url parameters and query parameters in WebSocket routes.

For example consider having a WebSocket Url like

`ws://myawesome.site/kemal?username=sdogruyol`

Now you can access these variables from your url within your `ws` route :sunglasses:

```ruby
ws "/:room_name" do |socket, env|
  env.params.url["room_name"] # => kemal
  env.params.query["username"] # => sdogruyol
end
```

## Customizable Static File Headers :clap:

Another long wanted feature, which adds support for customizing the headers of built-in `Kemal::StaticFileHandler` :hammer: Useful for single page applications which rely on `CORS`.

Here's a quick snippet for allowing `CORS` on `.js` files.

```ruby
static_headers do |response, filepath, filestat|
  if filepath =~ /\.js$/
      response.headers.add("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
    end
  end
end
```

## More Performance :rocket:

Kemal is built for being fast, we take *performance* seriously. In recent benchmarks we discovered that Kemal is being [pretty fast](https://files.gitter.im/crystal-lang/crystal/6NEf/Screenshot_20170904_221028.png). However, that's not a reason to stop us from getting faster :fire:

This release brings *%10-%15* performance increase in overall execution times.
