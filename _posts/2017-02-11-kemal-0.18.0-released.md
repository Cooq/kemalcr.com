Hello everyone,

Kemal 0.18.0 is here :tada: Kemal gets better yet becoming simpler :heartpulse:

## Simpler File Upload

File uploads can now be accessed from request `params` like `env.params.files["filename"]`.

It has 5 useful methods to get the job done!

- `tmpfile`: This is the temporary file for file upload. Useful for saving or manipulating the upload file.
- `tmpfile_path`: File path of `tmpfile`.
- `filename`: File name of the file upload. (`logo.png`, `images.zip` e.g)
- `meta`: Meta information for the file upload.
- `headers`: Request headers for the file upload.

Here's a fully working sample for reading an image file upload with key `image1` and saving it under `public/uploads`.

```ruby
post "/upload" do |env|
  file = env.params.files["image1"].tmpfile
  file_path = ::File.join [Kemal.config.public_folder, "uploads/", file.filename]
  File.open(file_path, "w") do |f|
    IO.copy(file, f)
  end
  "Upload ok"
end
```

You can test this with below `curl` command.

`curl -F "image1=@/Users/serdar/Downloads/kemal.png" http://localhost:3000/upload`

## File Streaming

Streaming is a serious business and Kemal has you covered :sunglasses: This release adds [RFC7233](http://www.rfc-base.org/rfc-7233.html) support. 

What this practically means is that you can partially request a file from Kemal without downloading the rest by utilizing HTTP Range header. Ain't that cool :sushi:
