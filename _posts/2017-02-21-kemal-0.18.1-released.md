Hello everyone,

It's just been 59 minutes since [Crystal 0.21.0 is released](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/crystal-lang/sGxeIxlLKX4) and Kemal 0.18.1 is already here :rocket: 

- Crystal 0.21.0 support :heart:
- Drop `multipart.cr` dependency. `multipart` support is now built-into Crystal <3
- Since Crystal 0.21.0 comes built-in with `multipart` there are some minor changes.

`meta` has been removed from `FileUpload` and now it has the following properties

  + `tmpfile`: This is temporary file for file upload. Useful for saving the upload file.
  + `filename`: File name of the file upload. (logo.png, images.zip e.g)
  + `headers`: Headers for the file upload.
  + `creation_time`: Creation time of the file upload.
  + `modification_time`: Last Modification time of the file upload.
  + `read_time`: Read time of the file upload.
  + `size`: Size of the file upload.

P.S: File uploads are faster :fire:

Happy Crystalling!
