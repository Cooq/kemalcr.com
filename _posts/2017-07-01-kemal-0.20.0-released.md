>Kemal is a Fast, Simple, Effective web framework written in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/).

Hello everyone,

Kemal 0.20.0 is here :tada: This release brings more modularity and performance :rocket:

## Crystal 0.23.0 support ‚ú®

The latest Crystal 0.23.0 release is already supported by Kemal. Just update your `shard.yml` to use Kemal `0.20.0` :sunglasses:

```yml
dependencies:
  kemal:
    github: kemalcr/kemal
    version: 0.20.0
```

## Customizable Handlers :clap:

Great news everyone üéâ All handlers are now completely ***customizable***!. Use the default `Kemal` handlers or go wild to build your own custom framework, it's all up to you ‚õè

```ruby
# Don't forget to add `Kemal::RouteHandler::INSTANCE` or your routes won't work!
Kemal.config.handlers = [Kemal::InitHandler.new, YourHandler.new, Kemal::RouteHandler::INSTANCE]
```

You can also insert a handler into a specific position.

```ruby
# This adds MyCustomHandler instance to 1 position. Be aware that the index starts from 0.
add_handler MyCustomHandler.new, 1
```

Thanks for using and supporting Kemal. You can check the full [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kemalcr/kemal/releases/tag/v0.20.0) here.

Happy Crystalling :heart:
